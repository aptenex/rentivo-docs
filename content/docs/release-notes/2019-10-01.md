###	Brand Renaming of Procuro to Rentivo Manage

We are beginning work on our process to start phasing out the Procuro brand name in favour of using Rentivo Manage. 
This is in-line with a larger branding restructure that we are completing for all of our product names.

You will still see "Procuro" used on notifications and messaging for the near forseeable future, however, over time it will be replaced entirely with Rentivo Manage.
