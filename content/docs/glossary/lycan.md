<p>
Lycan is a multi-tenanted platform as a service (PaaS) which solves the technical challenges faced with vacation rental distribution and curation. Using Lycan we extract, transform, load and validate vacation rental property data from various integration partners who have listings which they are interested in distributing to our partner network.

More Inventory

The purpose of Lycan is then to allow brands to curate properties under a common business purpose, receive inventory for their already existing marketplace, set up commercials for distribution of the properties and use Lycan to manage your business requirements and rules.

Channel Management
---

Additionally, Lycan allows for your technical team to supply reference data (ie from your own property management system), extract the data based on importing rules, validate the source data, transform it by cleaning it, applying business rules, and checking general data integrity, property data can then be staged in collections which allow you to curate rentals based on validation rules and finally publish properties to our integration partners, such as Airbnb, HomeAway, Booking.com, or our various meta marktplace websites or client websites that use our booking engine technology.

<h3>Who is Lycan built for?</h3>
<p>
    Lycan is primarily built for software businesses who want to focus on their core operations without stressing over the complexities of data integrations with various supplies and vendors.
    <ul>
        <li>Marketplaces who want to increase their inventory from various property management systems and do not have the capacity to handle their own data integrations.</li>
        <li>Property management software suppliers who want to connect their inventory to various third party marketplaces/channels for distribution.</li>
        <li>Payment platforms who might need access to enquiry/booking data to automatically connect booking data to an external guest relationship enquiry platform</li>
        <li>Meta-marketplaces who might want inventory from various partners and who can supply reservations/enquiries back to managers</li>
        <li>Channel Managers who want to complement Lycan with additional reach to more channels and marketplaces</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Lycan is <i>not</i> built for managers or owners. If you want distribution/channel management you can reach out to one of our PMS partners who use Lycan and engage with their PMS directly.</p>
